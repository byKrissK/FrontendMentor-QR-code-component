## My process

1. Open the unzipped files with VS code, read the instructions and style guide, as well as the design images.
2. Create div.class of different containers in HTML for easy css layout later.
3. Add google font link in the head section.
4. Reset margin and padding to 0, as well as border-box for box-sizing. This will make the measurement more accurate during the styling process.
5. Set html{font-size to 62.5% which equal to 10px}, for easier calculation in rem.
6. Set colors, font-family, and other basic properties before styling the classes.
7. Used display:flex for the layout.
8. Place the live browser with the design image side by side to have a better judgement while styling especially resizing the containers.
9. Style the attribution as footer.
10. Checked the layout with web responsive window turned on to view on different screen sizes.

### Built with

- CSS Flex

### What I learned

More familiar with the common properties of flex display.

### Continued development

Will practice and master more flex properties that are not used in this project, before moving on to css grid. Also, will try to create reusable classes so that I don't have to keep on repeating the same style for different classes.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to understand more on the property whenever I got stucked.
